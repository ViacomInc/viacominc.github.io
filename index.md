### Welcome to Viacom Open Source Software
After years of using open source software in [Viacom, Inc.](http://www.viacom.com)'s Multiplatform Engineering team, we have begun to open source some of our own code. We are a proud team of engineers who believe in software engineering as a craft. We build Viacom's public facing web sites and apps along with the services and tools to support them. The work we do for our great brands like Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Spike, and others around the world drives delivery of our content to many screens including the Web, iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, Roku, XBox, and more. We love the work we do and we hope you find the projects we open source useful, too.
